  Q) Are there any travel restrictions while on J-1 visa after filing I-140?

  A) It is generally advised that are in a non-immigrant visa status
     that does not allow immigrant intent (such as your J-1 visa) against
     traveling outside of the U.S. after filing the I-140 in order to avoid
     potential issues with re-entry into the U.S. since, by filing the I-140,
     you will be demonstrating your intent to immigrate to some extent.
